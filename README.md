# Lidar_project
I received data from a Lidar sensor that scanned a room. You can find this in the Data files folder.
Using pycharm (python 3.9) with open3d, pandas and numpy libraries I wrote a code, which can read in Lidar data from a CSV file, then it creates a point-cloud to visualize the data. Furthermore it also enables some analysis of the specific data, like selecting the wall or measuring the cylinder object.

The goal of this project was to get familiar with point-clouds.
